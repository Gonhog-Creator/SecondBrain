Frequency Response
Suppose that the input is sinusoidal: u(t) = A sin(ωt)
Radial frequency: ω [rad/min (or sec)]
Period: T = 2π/ω, frequency: f = 1/T = ω/2π [cycles/min(or sec)]
▶ Amplitude: A > 0
▶

▶

Frequency response: y(t) = Â sin(ωt + ϕ) will hold, when t is
sufficiently large
▶
▶

Output will also be sinusoidal, with the same period (frequency)
It is of interest to know Â/A (amplitude ratio) and ϕ (phase angle)

Why does this matter?
Process disturbances can be viewed as small oscillations
Frequency response will play an important role in control
▶ Applied in relevant engineering areas – communications, experimental
data processing, AI, etc.

**Testimony of ChatGPT
Dr. Tang asks: Some people believe that frequency response should not be taught to
undergraduates because it’s too hard. Do you agree?
I don’t agree that frequency response should be excluded from undergraduate curricula.
While it can be challenging, it offers valuable insights that are essential for a
comprehensive understanding of control systems. Here are a few reasons.
1 Fundamental Concept: Frequency response is foundational to control theory. It

connects theory with practical applications like filter design, communications, ...
2 Visualization of System Behavior: Tools like Bode plots and Nyquist diagrams

provide intuitive ways to understand system behavior, stability, and performance
without complex mathematics.
3 Industry Relevance: Frequency response techniques are widely used in industries

ranging from aerospace to automotive and electronics. Exposing students to these
concepts better prepares them for real-world challenges.
4 Supports Robust Design: Frequency response aids in designing systems that are

robust to disturbances and uncertainties, an essential skill in engineering practice.
5 Enhances Problem-Solving Skills: Learning challenging topics like frequency

response helps students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which
are valuable beyond control theory.

Consider G(s) = s+1
, u(t) = sin(ωt)

t = 0:0.1:(30/omega); u = sin(omega*t);
y = lsim(tf(1, [1, 1]), u, t);

Observation: Â/A and ϕ depends on ω

General conclusion about frequency response
G(s) at s = iω determines frequency response!!
If G(s) is a stable system, then G(iω) in polar coordinate satisfies:
G(iω) = (A.R.)eiϕ .
In other words, at radial frequency ω,
A.R. = |G(iω)|, ϕ = ∠G(iω)

Example 1: First-order lag G(s) = τ s+1

∠G(iω) = ∠K − ∠(1 + iωτ ) = − arctan(ωτ ) = ϕ ✓

Example 2: Lead-lag

G(s) =

1 + τ0 s
1 + τ1 s

s=iω

⇒ G(iω) =

1 + iωτ0
1 + iωτ1

Evaluate modulus and angle:
q
1 + ω 2 τ02
|1 + iωτ0 |
A.R. = |G(iω)| =
=q
|1 + iωτ1 |
1 + ω 2 τ12
ϕ = ∠G(iω) = ∠(1+iωτ0 )−∠(1+iωτ1 ) = arctan(ωτ0 )−arctan(ωτ1 )
When ω → 0: A.R.→ 1, ϕ → 0
When ω → ∞: A.R.→ τ0 /τ1 , ϕ → 0
If τ0 > τ1 (lead dominates), A.R.↑, ϕ ≥ 0 and has a max.
If τ0 < τ1 (lag dominates), A.R.↓, ϕ ≤ 0 and has a min.

ϕ = ∠G(iω) = ∠(K/ω) − ∠i = −π/2
A.R. ∝ ω −1 . The first plot of Bode is a
line with slope −1 (in log-log)
ϕ = −π/2 for an integrator. The
second plot of Bode is a constant

Example 4: Time delay
G(s) = e−θs (θ > 0)

s=iω

⇒ G(iω) = e−iωθ

Evaluate modulus and angle:
A.R. = |G(iω)| = |e−iωθ | = 1
ϕ = ∠G(iω) = ∠e−iωθ = −ωθ
A.R. is a constant 1 (naturally!)
ϕ is endlessly decreasing
